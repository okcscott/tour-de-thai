# Le Tour De Thai

This was a little project I threw together for a little office pool we were running for the Tour de France. We pick a squad of riders, fantasy sport style, and then gain points throughout the competition. The winner gets taken to lunch at a local Thai restaurant, and gets bragging rights for the next year.

## Technology

+ Sinatra
+ [google_drive](https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby)
+ [jquery.mixitup](http://mixitup.io)

## Etc

I used a google spreadsheet as the data store so that [Kaleb](https://twitter.com/kalebnimz) could update the scores and keep his separate spreadsheet with his mad scientist formulas, and not have to enter the data somewhere else also.

The site is responsive, so our competitors could check their scores on the go.
